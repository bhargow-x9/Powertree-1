# 🌳 PowerTree

PowerTree is a **small wind energy system** designed to collect power from **slow and changing wind**.

It uses **many small wind units** placed on a tree-like structure instead of one large turbine.  
This helps the system work better in places where wind direction and speed change often.

This repository contains **documentation and study material** for team members and students.

## 🌬️ System Idea

- Tree-style structure  
- Multiple small wind rotors  
- Each rotor works independently  
- Wind from any direction can be used  

Using many small units improves reliability and smooth power generation.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. Wind flows from any direction  
2. Small vertical rotors start rotating  
3. Rotation drives a small generator  
4. Electrical output is collected  
5. Power can be stored or used directly  

Each unit works separately, so failure of one unit does not stop the system.

## ⚡ Why This Design Works Well

- Starts rotating at low wind speed  
- Handles changing wind direction  
- Produces less noise  
- Safer than large turbines  
- Easy to scale by adding more units
